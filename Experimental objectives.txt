	Using N-1 or N-2 technique (disconnecting some branches), we can figure out which events trigger substantial voltage decrease. Based on the most severe disturbances, design a simple UVLS
	scheme to shed some load. Once thats implemented, we can worry about parameters.

	Just implement a simple UVLS technique which disconnects a certain amount of load (uniformly) throughout the system when the voltage (average over a set of HV buses)
	fall below a certain threshold for a certain duration. Can consult MLV2000 for some reference numbers for the parameters.
	
	Figure out how to implement UVLS and UFLS and to tune their parameters, and see whats happening. So, lets say we see a disturbance and subsequent 
	protection being applied, and then we keep track of the voltage and frequency and apply the schemes and see how the power system behaves. Based on the 
	simulation on different UVLS and UFLS settings, we can figure out what are suitable parameters.
