Run a 5 second nodist test on savnw and run a 5 second simulation with a fault at some bus at 1 s.
Compare the voltages and identify the time step where the results start changing.
From that time step, assume that the system is able to identify the event, apply it and rerun the simulations
So, there should be a main script which runs all the other scripts:
	Two scripts (one for each simulation)
	A script to compare the results and identify the time step when the event happens
	Another script to start the simulation from that time step, with the event applied in the beginning
