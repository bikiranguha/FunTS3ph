	#Verify the results of tmp_N_1PF.py. Currently it outputs the average voltage of depth 2 neighbours of the branch after its outaged. Once verified, sort the results in descending order.
	#Extend the work to N-2 contingencies.
	Try to analyse the voltages values using the dictionary class i created. It can give an idea of which buses consistently have low voltages and then i can isolate nearby loads.
	After figuring out which pockets are the most sensitive, we can split the loads in those pockets into sheddable part and a non-sheddable part. 
	After thats done, we should implement transformer outages (both ends have to be HV)
	
	
	
	#Instead of considering average voltage of all HV buses,consider the average voltage drop in HV buses within a certain depth of both sides of the branch.
	After figuring out which pockets are the most sensitive, we can split the loads in those pockets into sheddable part and a non-sheddable part. 
	
	
	Figure out how to shed load. Maybe we can run P-V sensitivity analysis to figure out shedding which load will have the most effect.
	Test whether using power flow, we can get the same results for average voltage for line outage as we got from the TS3ph

	For fun: 
	  Try to do a PV analysis using python and PSSE. See if PSSE has a PV analysis tool. Keep increasing load and see how the voltage drops (see G:\My Drive\My PhD research\UVLS\undervoltage_loadshedding.pdf) for reference

	Using N-1 or N-2 technique (disconnecting some branches), we can figure out which events trigger substantial voltage decrease. Based on the most severe disturbances, design a simple UVLS
	scheme to shed some load. Once thats implemented, we can worry about parameters.

	Just implement a simple UVLS technique which disconnects a certain amount of load (uniformly) throughout the system when the voltage (average over a set of HV buses)
	fall below a certain threshold for a certain duration. Can consult MLV2000 for some reference numbers for the parameters.
	
	Figure out how to implement UVLS and UFLS and to tune their parameters, and see whats happening. So, lets say we see a disturbance and subsequent 
	protection being applied, and then we keep track of the voltage and frequency and apply the schemes and see how the power system behaves. Based on the 
	simulation on different UVLS and UFLS settings, we can figure out what are suitable parameters.
