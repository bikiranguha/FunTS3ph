batch_plot_v_0922.py: File from which batch_get_v.py is derived (copied from 'CAPE-TS Simulations' project)
batch_get_v.py: Original file to get all the complex voltage info (mag and angle) under a structure with the bus number as the key
batch_get_v_fault.py: Basically tries to simulate the real world cases, where some event happens. (derived from batch_get_v.py)
batch_get_v_nodist.py: Tries to simulate TS3ph running, so no disturbance (derived from batch_get_v.py)
